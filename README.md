INTRODUCTION:
Currently, being able to predict that something might be popular beforehand is an important research subject for every industry. 
It has recently become a very important subject for the growing and competitive music industry as well. The given dataset is related to the
listening behaviors of the listeners of the Spotify digital music platform. It indicates the liking/disliking of the songs that have been played
on Spotify. Spotify Trends can help any content creator/musician to understand what listeners prefer and how to compete in this immensely growing
market. Based on the given data, I developed and analyzed ML algorithms to predict song preference based on the given features and tried to
achieve the maximum accuracy that I can.
